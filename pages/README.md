# :books: PAGES

### Takeaways
#### In Nuxt apps, every file within pages ending in `.vue` will be considered a route. You can create more complex routes by creating subfolders.
#### `index.vue` is the root route i.e. `my-website.com/`

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).
