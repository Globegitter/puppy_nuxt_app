# :rainbow: :dog: Puppy Nuxt App

## The two primary focuses of this project are two of Nuxt's main features:
```### Server-side rendering
### Routing
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
